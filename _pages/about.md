Iâ€™m Mihir Patel, a Data Scientist from Tampa, currently pursuing further education in Computer Science through UF-Online.

Been fortunate enough to gain and share knowledge in the academic space for six-plus years.

Worked as a Data Scientist at [Luminosity, Inc.](http://luminosity-solutions.com/).

Worked as a Data Analyst at [SWFWMD](https://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/).

Also, I was a [tutor](https://www.hccfl.edu/support-services/academic-success-centers) and a [research assistant](https://lonihagen.wordpress.com/) at the Hillsborough Community College and the University of South Florida, respectively.

Did a Data Engineering internship at [Western Union](https://www.westernunion.com/us/en/home.html). It was an amazing experience.

Proficient in R, Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Shiny, Excel, C++. However, can quickly learn new stuff.

I enjoy reading what goes around the world (esp. in regions of East Asia, South Asia and the South East Asia) in free-time. 

Want to get into generative art sometime soon. Cool stuff. 

Always ready for collabrating. Learning. Growing. 

Thank you for stopping by.
