Most popular fractals are variations of the Mandelbrot Set, sharing the same fundamental equation:

`F = {x² + c| c is a constant, x is an iterated number}`

**Meet the Julia Set**

Named after Dr. Gaston Julia, Julia Sets represent a family of fractals that showcase nature's intricate patterns. Let's explore how they differ from their famous cousin, the Mandelbrot Set.


**The Mathematical Dance**

The key difference lies in how we handle the constants:
- Mandelbrot Set: We substitute different values of `c` from the complex plane, using each result as the next `x`
- Julia Set: We keep `c` fixed and vary our starting point `Z₀`, creating unique patterns with each chosen constant

Here's how we implement this in R:
```r
# Complex parameter, connected to coordinate of the Mandelbrot set in a complex plane
a <- -0.4
b <- -0.6

#coloring code....

#fixed numbers of steps
steps <- seq(fixed_limits[1], fixed_limits[2], by= 0.01)

#We keep each point in the array/matrix
points_matrix <- array(0, dim= c(length(steps) * length(steps), 3))

a1 <- 0

for(x in steps) {
  for(y in steps) {
    n <- 0
    distance <- 0
    # Copy original x and y
    x1 <- x
    y1 <- y 
      
      #This distance limit specific
      while(n < max_iteration & distance<4) {
        newx <- x1^2 - y1^2 + a
        newy <- 2 * x1 * y1 + b
        distance <- newx^2 + newy^2
        x1 <- newx
        y1 <- newy
        n <- n+1
      }
    
    if(distance < 4){
      #We pick the color for the number not in the step
      pick_color <- 24
    }
    else{
      #We pick the color for the number not in the step
      pick_color <- n*10 
    }
    
    a1 <- a1 + 1 #Next number
    points_matrix[a1, ]= c(x,y, pick_color)
    
  }
}

# plot() code.
```

**The Beauty of Variation**

Different values of `c` create dramatically different patterns:

1. `Zn= x^2 +(-0.4+(-0.6i))`

2. `Zn= x^2 +(0+0.8i)`
<p align="center"> 
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/julia/Julia_unoptimized_2.png" alt="">
</p>

3. `Zn= x^2 +(-0.34+ (-0.9i))`
<p align="center"> 
   <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/julia/Julia_unoptimized_3.png" alt="">
</p>

4. `Zn= x^2 +(0.355+ 0.355i)`
<p align="center">

</p>

**The Hidden Connection**

Each endpoint of the Mandelbrot Set's black region represents a potential value of `c` that generates a unique Julia Set. This deep connection suggests a profound truth, which is, these seemingly different patterns are intimately linked, much like the interconnected nature of reality itself.
