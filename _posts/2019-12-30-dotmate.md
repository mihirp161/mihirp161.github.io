Health education should be accessible and comfortable for everyone. That's why I created dotMate - a conversational program that provides reliable information about menstrual health while maintaining a friendly, judgment-free environment.

**What Makes dotMate Special?**

Unlike typical menu-driven applications, dotMate creates natural conversations. Simply ask questions as you would to a friend - "What is a period?" or "Can a woman's period change?" Don't worry about perfect typing; the program uses advanced fuzzy string matching (Levenshtein Distance algorithm) to understand your questions even with typos or mistakes.

**Key Features**

**1. Personalized Experience**

  The program remembers returning users, greeting them by name to create a more personal connection:

**2. Smart Question-Answering**

  dotMate provides clear, accurate information about menstruation:
- Direct matches appear in green for easy reading
- Similar questions are suggested when an exact match isn't found
- Intelligent typo correction ensures you get the information you need

**3. Period Calendar Tool**

  After extensive research and consultation with women from all walks of life - including mothers, friends, teachers, and healthcare professionals - I developed a comprehensive period tracking tool that:

- Predicts your next period date
- Flags unusual cycle lengths
- Creates a printable calendar for planning
- Includes inspiring quotes (courtesy of my mom's wisdom!)

**How to Use**

1. Ask questions naturally about menstruation and women's health
2. For period tracking, try phrases like:
   - "Hey! I want to calculate my next period?"
   - "I am planning a vacation with my wife so...?"
3. To exit, simply type "Exit the program! Bye!"

**Looking Forward**

This project aims to make menstrual health information more accessible and less intimidating. While it currently includes the 50 most common questions about menstruation, there's always room for growth. I welcome contributions and suggestions for enhancement!
